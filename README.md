# Interactive Haskell Notebooks
To run this, you need [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?offering=community&type=edition)

Basically, all you need to do is open up a terminal with docker enabled and run `docker run -p 8888:8888 a9rkzz/ihaskell-nb` and then visit [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888). By default, the password is `jupyter`

If you want to dig deeper, everything used to create this setup can be found in this repository
